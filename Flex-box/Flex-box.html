                        The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of 
                        classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language 
                        has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) 
                        to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform.

                    <p>
                        In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, 
                        which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5. Entire new APIs, 
                        such as Swing and Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated.
